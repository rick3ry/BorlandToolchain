It is assumed that Borland 4.5 is installed to c:\bc45
and that pharlap is installed to c:\tnt

Copy the files in shims to c:\bc45\bin.  They are scripts and are intended to
be as readable as scripts get; your mileage may vary.

For now the only way to use this toolchain is in development / debug mode.
Shadow copies of the toolchains are enabled as described here:
    https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/cnd/toolchain.html

Copy this toolchain project into NetBeans, Clean and Build, then run.
  (Note: I have found it important to ...
      Clean and Build, not just Build, for this project)

After you Run the project, a fresh (second) copy of NetBeans will start.  This
fresh copy will be as though you had just installed.  You may need to turn the
NetBeans 8.2 Plugin Portal support on and install C/C++.

You should not need to install this toolchain when run this way.  It should
show up automatically when you look under C/C++ in Tools->Options.  Only if you
have played with the scripts might you need to press "Restore Defaults" to get
this toolchain to appear.

When using this toolchain for a project:
The build directory expects a BCC32.CFG file with configuration information for
the Borland compiler (just the standard file the Borland compiler expects; the
install directory has examples of them).  It also expects a pharlap.lnk options
file for the 386Link Pharlap linker.
Examples of pharlap.lnk and BCC32.CFG are included.

The build will attempt to run 'rebindb' to integrate the pharlap extender into
the extended DOS executable.

When used in a separate project, the toolchain will compile and assemble any C,
C++, or ASM modules then link them with the pharlap linker.
After the link, the resultant pharlap executable is combined with the pharlap
libraries and primitive NT-like operating system to form an extended DOS program.
